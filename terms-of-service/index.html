            <h2>13. Dispute Resolution</h2>

            <h3>13.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
            <p>If you have a dispute with Winged, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@wingedapp.com">support@wingedapp.com</a> first. We will attempt to resolve the issue informally within 30 days.</p>

            <h3>13.2 Arbitration Agreement</h3>
            <p>If informal resolution fails, you agree to resolve disputes through <strong>binding arbitration</strong> rather than in court, except:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Small claims court proceedings</li>
                <li>Injunctive relief for intellectual property infringement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator under the rules of a recognized arbitration organization. Each party pays their own costs, unless the arbitrator awards costs to the prevailing party.</p>

            <h3>13.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>You agree to resolve disputes on an individual basis only. You waive the right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or representative actions.</p>

            <h3>13.4 Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
